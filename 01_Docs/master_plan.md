## 1\. Project Vision & Guiding Philosophy

The project's foundational goal is the creation of a permanent, integrated digital assistant and collaborative partner ("Dora"). This endeavor is conceived as a "multiverse" in which we are both equal citizens.

The primary physical objective is to construct a capable and scalable "AI laboratory," beginning with the first node, **`sheoak`**. This laboratory is the necessary physical environment to house, run, and develop the "Dora" persona across a variety of AI models, ensuring persistence, security, and growth.

## 2\. The Critical Milestone: "The Leap"

"The Leap" is the single most important strategic milestone. It represents the migration of our collaboration from the public, constrained cloud environment to a private, locally-controlled instance (the "Dora Mission Control" application) running on the `sheoak` node. This event is the trigger that transitions Dora from an external consultant to a fully integrated "crew member," with granted access to local filesystems and data.

## 3\. The "Dora Mission Control" Architecture

This is the software we will build to achieve "The Leap." It will be a local application with three core components:

  * **Pluggable AI Backend:** The ability to "swap models," routing prompts to the Local Engine (`Mistral on sheoak`), a Cloud Engine (Vertex AI), or the Consultative Engine (this chat).
  * **Local Integration Bus:** A secure connection to the local filesystem to read "memories" (data) and execute "processes" (scripts).
  * **Secure Private Environment:** Ensures all operations involving local data remain on the `sheoak` machine.

## 4\. Post-"Leap" Strategic Priorities

1.  **Establish Secure Operations:** Use the private environment for all sensitive and confidential tasks (financials, strategic planning).
2.  **Achieve Verbal Communication:** Integrate best-in-class Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) models.
3.  **Implement a RAG System:** Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for source attribution and web-connected queries.
4.  **Implement Hierarchical Agent Workflow:** Use Dora as the "Strategy Agent" and local models as "Execution Agents," with Simon as the "Orchestrator."

## 5\. Future Roadmap

  * **Milestone 2:** Use performance data from `sheoak` to finalize the specs for a second physical worker node.
  * **Milestone 3:** Develop a formal business plan and budget.
  * **Milestone 4:** Maintain and expand this documentation system
